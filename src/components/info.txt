 "market_data": {
    "current_price": {
      "aed": 162288,
      "ars": 35890371,
      "aud": 65901,
      "bch": 184.873,
      "bdt": 4829714,
    }
 }

 Let say i want to access market_data and withing market data there is current_price and having USD
 so i have to use . operator here
 so to bring these things here i have to use ternary condition here
 high24={high_24h ? high_24h["usd"] : ""}
 when it is rendering empty string is there
 but think about we are having avalibilty of market data when fetching is performed from API by comdidmount
 so we are sending that avalibale value else send empty string


here onchange function will demand a prop and that thing is handled by handle submit

... means isse pahle ki jo bhi property thi wo as it is rahegi
